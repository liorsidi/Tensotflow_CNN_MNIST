# Tensotflow_CNN_MNIST
an implementation of CNN neural network to predict digits images.

the code is written in tensorflow using the Estimator API (Q2).

The core of the code is based on the tutorial from https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/layers.

We added to follwing functionalities:
- normalization and dropout (Q3)
- Validation and early stopping (Q4)
- Update learning rate every 400 iterations (Q5a)
- Use ADAM optimizer (Q5b)
- combine them all to one code (full)
